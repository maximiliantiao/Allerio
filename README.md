# Allerio Website

During Summer 2019, I joined the Web Development Team for Allerio, a health and wellness based startup in San Francisco. The team and I were asked to create a website for the startup.

The website unfortuately has no content, but I designed most of the website using a provided GoDaddy hosting service and WordPress site. The homepage was developed by me and the designs came from my team along with Allerio staff including Charles Young, our founder.
